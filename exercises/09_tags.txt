- create a "server" with two users.
- create tags by one of the users.
	- create unsigned tags
	- create signed tag (git tag -s)
- do tags get passed to server or to the other users when you push and pull?
- if yes how can you stop tags being pushed around.
- if no how can you make tags pass?
	* checkout the --tags/--follow-tags flag to "git push"
	or the [tags]/followTags = true in the git configuration.

NOTES:
- in order to sign tags you need to:
	- have your own private key (we already did that)
	- tell git to user your key ([user] signingkey= in your .gitconfig)
