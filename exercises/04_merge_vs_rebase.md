- open a server repo using:
	$ "git init --bare"
- use that repo to simulate the work of two users working against
that repo.
- simulate two ways of merging the code that these two users write:
- the "merge" way
	by using "git pull"
	which is really "git fetch" and "git merge"
	under the hood
- the "rebase" way
	by using "git fetch"
	and "git rebase"
	* bonus points: try the --interactive flag to git-rebase
Compare the two ways of working in terms of the git log of the master
repository after the work has been done.
