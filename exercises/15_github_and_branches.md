* Configure git to use your newly created private/public keypair.

    [user]
        signingkey = 73C128F9
===============
    Your key id is the last 8 characters of your full key id.
    You can use either a text editor or:
    $ git config --global user.signingkey [yourkeyid]
* Create a repository in your github account.
* Clone your project to your laptop/desktop.
* add files, commit, see your change in github.com
