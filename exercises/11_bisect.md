Git bisect exercise - use git to find a commit
that introduced a bug...

- create a new repo
- create a first commit for that repo
- create a test script within the repository which succeeds.
- create 10 commits on top of the first commit where commit number 7
	breaks the code.
- use git bisect and find the change that introduced the bug.
